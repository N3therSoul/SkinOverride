Skin Override Mod
=================

Why
---
Makes possibile changing skins ingame. 
This may allow some fun interactions between players without having to restart the client every time.

How
---
Through chat, type the command "/skin <url>"
The specified url must link to a png file containing a skin in the right template.

Cool
----
The specified skin (as long as the template keeps the right proportions) can be of any resolution.
This allow more HD skin that are not supported by the default skin API in Minecraft.
